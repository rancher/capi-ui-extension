Some notes:\n    - Text in double-dollar-strings is _always_ interpreted as some programming code. Text\n      in ordinary quotes is _never_ interpreted that way and highlighted just as a string.\n    - There are quite a bit \"special cases\". That's because many keywords are not strictly\n      they are keywords in some contexts and ordinary identifiers in others. Only some\n      of such cases are handled; you still can get some of your identifiers highlighted\n      wrong way.\n    - Function names deliberately are not highlighted. There is no way to tell function\n      call from other constructs, hence we can't highlight _all_ function names.
